# 📋 Console Logging Implementation for LLM Context

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

I've added comprehensive console logging to show the current context that will be sent to the LLM when a user sends a message.

## 🔍 **What Gets Logged**

### **1. Message Processing Start**
```
=== MESSAGE PROCESSING START ===
Raw User Message: [user's message]
Session Available: true/false
Active Thread ID: [thread-id]
================================
```

### **2. Normal Chat Messages**
```
=== USER MESSAGE SENT ===
User Message: [user's message]
Active Thread ID: [thread-id]
Current Conversation History ( X messages):
  [0] human: [previous user message...]
  [1] ai: [previous ai response...]
  [2] human: [another user message...]
  ...
System Message: [system message or "No system message"]
About to send to LLM - Total context messages: X
========================
```

### **3. Template Generation Requests**
```
=== TEMPLATE GENERATION REQUEST ===
Template Type: [API Reference/User Guide/etc.]
System Message Length: [character count]
Relevant Files Count: [number]
Relevant Files: [array of file paths]
Total Content Length: [character count]
Files and Contents Preview (first 500 chars): [content preview...]
====================================
```

## 🎯 **What This Helps You See**

1. **Current Conversation Context**: All previous messages that will be sent to the LLM
2. **System Message**: The system prompt being used for the session
3. **Message History**: Complete conversation history with message types and content
4. **Content Size**: How much context is being sent (important for token limits)
5. **Template Context**: For template generation, shows which files are being analyzed
6. **Session State**: Whether the session is properly initialized

## 📍 **Where to Find the Logs**

1. Open **Developer Tools** in VS Code (`Help > Toggle Developer Tools`)
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Send a message in the NaruhoDocs chat
4. Look for the detailed logging output

## 🔧 **Logging Locations Added**

1. **Line ~515**: Initial message processing start
2. **Line ~600**: Detailed context for normal chat messages  
3. **Line ~575**: Template generation context and file analysis

## 🎉 **Benefits**

- **Debug Context Issues**: See exactly what context the AI has access to
- **Optimize Conversations**: Understand how conversation history builds up
- **Token Management**: Monitor context size for large conversations
- **Template Debugging**: See which files are being analyzed for documentation generation
- **Session Troubleshooting**: Verify session state and system messages

## 🚀 **Ready to Use**

The logging is now active! When you send any message in the NaruhoDocs chat, you'll see detailed console output showing exactly what context and history is being sent to the LLM.
