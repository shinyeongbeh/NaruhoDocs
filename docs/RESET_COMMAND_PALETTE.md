# 🔄 Reset Chat Command

## Overview

The Reset Chat functionality is now available in **two ways**:

1. **🖱️ Reset Icon** - Click the reset icon in the chat interface (top-right corner)
2. **⌨️ Command Palette** - Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for "Reset Chat Conversation"

## Command Palette Access

### How to Use:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "**reset chat**" or "**NaruhoDocs: Reset Chat**"
3. Select "🔄 Reset Chat Conversation" from the list
4. The active chat session will be reset immediately

### Command Details:
- **Command ID**: `naruhodocs.resetChat`
- **Title**: "🔄 Reset Chat Conversation"
- **Category**: "NaruhoDocs"
- **Scope**: Affects only the currently active chat thread

## What Gets Reset:

✅ **Chat message history** - All conversation messages are cleared  
✅ **AI context memory** - AI forgets previous conversation context  
✅ **Workspace storage** - Thread history removed from VS Code storage  
✅ **UI state** - Chat interface refreshed with clean state  

## User Feedback:

When reset via command palette:
- ✅ **Success Message**: "Chat conversation has been reset."
- ⚠️ **Warning Message**: Shown if no active chat session is available

When reset via UI icon:
- 🔄 **System Message**: "Conversation reset. Chat history cleared." appears in chat

## Technical Implementation:

### Frontend (UI):
- Reset icon in header with hover/active states
- Keyboard shortcut support (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)
- Confirmation dialog for safety

### Backend (Command):
- Public method: `resetActiveChat()` in `ChatViewProvider`
- Command registration: `naruhodocs.resetChat`
- Error handling for edge cases
- Console logging for debugging

### Storage:
- Clears workspace state: `thread-history-${threadId}`
- Resets session memory in active chat thread
- Maintains thread structure (doesn't delete thread)

## Benefits:

🚀 **Multiple Access Methods** - Users can choose their preferred way to reset  
🎯 **Quick Access** - Command palette is accessible from anywhere in VS Code  
📋 **Consistent Behavior** - Both methods perform identical reset operations  
🛡️ **Safe Operation** - Clear feedback and proper error handling  
💡 **Discovery** - Command palette makes the feature more discoverable  

## Usage Tips:

- Use when you want to start a fresh conversation with the AI
- Helpful when switching to a completely different topic
- Good for clearing context when the AI seems confused
- Accessible even when the NaruhoDocs panel is not visible
- No confirmation needed in command palette (instant reset)

Both the UI icon and command palette access provide the same robust reset functionality with appropriate user feedback!
