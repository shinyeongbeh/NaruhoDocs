# Project Discovery Enhancement Implementation

## Problem Identified

After implementing the visualization feature, users reported that when they asked the bot about the project's purpose (e.g., "what is this project about?"), the AI assistant would respond by asking the user to specify which files are most relevant instead of automatically discovering the project information.

**Example of problematic behavior:**
```
User: "What is this project about?"
Bot: "To provide an accurate summary, I need to understand the project's purpose by examining its files. Could you please tell me which files are most relevant for understanding the project's core functionality?"
```

This behavior contradicts the intended autonomous discovery capabilities of the AI assistant.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue had multiple contributing factors:

1. **Insufficient System Message Clarity**: The system message didn't explicitly emphasize automatic project discovery for general project questions
2. **Missing Project Context in Visualizations**: When visualizations were generated, the AI context didn't include comprehensive project understanding
3. **Ambiguous Instructions**: The system message contained general instructions about tool usage but wasn't specific enough about project discovery scenarios

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Message (`SystemMessages.ts`)

**Before:**
- Generic instructions about using tools proactively
- No specific guidance for project discovery scenarios
- Ambiguous "ask for clarification if necessary" instruction

**After:**
- **Explicit Project Discovery Section**: Added dedicated section for project understanding
- **Clear Auto-Discovery Process**: Step-by-step instructions for automatic project analysis
- **Explicit Prohibition**: "Never ask the user to tell you which files are relevant"
- **Specific Scenarios**: Clear guidance for different types of project questions

**Key additions:**
```typescript
## Project Understanding & Analysis üîç
**When users ask about the project's purpose, architecture, or functionality, you MUST automatically discover and analyze the project structure without asking for guidance.** 

**Auto-Discovery Process:**
1. **Immediately use retrieve_workspace_filenames** to get the complete project structure
2. **Automatically identify key files** like README.md, package.json, main entry points, and configuration files
3. **Use retrieve_file_content** to read and analyze these key files
4. **Synthesize your findings** into a comprehensive project summary

**Never ask the user to tell you which files are relevant.** You have the tools to discover this information yourself.
```

### 2. Enhanced Visualization Context (`VisualizationProvider.ts`)

**Added comprehensive project context when visualizations are generated:**

- **Project Context Method**: New `createProjectContext()` method that provides workspace information
- **Enhanced AI Context**: Updated `createDetailedAIContext()` to emphasize automatic discovery capabilities
- **Explicit Capability Statements**: Clear messaging that the AI can discover project information independently

**Key improvements:**
```typescript
**My Capabilities**: I can automatically discover and analyze any aspect of this project without needing guidance on which files to examine. I have tools to read the entire workspace and understand the project's purpose, architecture, and functionality.
```

### 3. Strengthened Rules and Guidelines

**Added explicit rules throughout the system:**
- "Auto-Discover, Don't Ask" principle
- Prohibition against asking for file specifications
- Emphasis on autonomous project analysis
- Clear capability statements in all contexts

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix
```
User: "What is this project about?"
Bot: "To provide an accurate summary, I need to understand the project's purpose by examining its files. Could you please tell me which files are most relevant?"
```

### After Fix
```
User: "What is this project about?"
Bot: [Automatically uses retrieve_workspace_filenames and retrieve_file_content tools]
"This is a VS Code extension called NaruhoDocs that provides AI-powered documentation assistance. Based on my analysis of your project files:

**Project Purpose**: [Comprehensive analysis based on actual files]
**Technology Stack**: [Discovered from package.json and source files]  
**Main Features**: [Identified from code analysis]
**Architecture**: [Understanding from file structure]"
```

## Implementation Details

### File Changes Made

1. **`src/SystemMessages.ts`**:
   - Added explicit project discovery section
   - Enhanced tool usage instructions
   - Added prohibition against asking for file guidance
   - Strengthened auto-discovery rules

2. **`src/VisualizationProvider.ts`**:
   - Enhanced `addVisualizationToAIHistory()` method
   - Added `createProjectContext()` method
   - Updated `createDetailedAIContext()` with capability statements
   - Improved context messaging for AI sessions

### Key Behavioral Changes

1. **Proactive Discovery**: AI must immediately use tools when asked about project purpose
2. **No User Prompting**: AI cannot ask users to specify which files are relevant
3. **Comprehensive Context**: Visualization context includes project understanding capabilities
4. **Clear Messaging**: All AI responses emphasize autonomous discovery capabilities

## Testing Instructions

1. **Generate any visualization** (Architecture, Folder Structure, or Document Relations)
2. **Ask general project questions** after visualization:
   - "What is this project about?"
   - "What does this project do?"
   - "Explain the project's purpose"
   - "What is the architecture of this project?"

3. **Verify expected behavior**:
   - AI should immediately start using tools (`retrieve_workspace_filenames`, `retrieve_file_content`)
   - AI should provide comprehensive project analysis without asking for guidance
   - No prompts for file specification should appear

4. **Check console logs** for tool usage:
   ```
   Called TOOL retrieve_workspace_filenames
   Called TOOL retrieve_file_content for [various files]
   ```

## Verification

The fix is working correctly when:
- AI automatically discovers project information using built-in tools
- No requests for file guidance appear in responses
- Comprehensive project analysis is provided based on actual file content
- Console shows automatic tool usage for project discovery
- User experience is seamless and autonomous

## Impact

This enhancement ensures that the AI assistant provides the intended autonomous experience where users can ask about their project and receive comprehensive, accurate information without needing to specify which files to examine or provide manual guidance.

The fix maintains the powerful analysis capabilities while eliminating the user friction of having to specify file relevance, making the tool much more user-friendly and aligned with its intended autonomous operation.
